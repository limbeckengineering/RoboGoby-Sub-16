Software for the submersible

This is where all completed feature classes will be stored. When there have been a sufficient number of completed features, a folder will be created that stiches the pieces into a piece of control software for the submersible.

Clone this repository and create a branch for your feature. When you know that the feature works, create a folder for the source code for the feature and push the branch back up. Then request it be merged with the master.
